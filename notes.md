## Intro to the Command Line
1 hour, Beginner <br>

_command line_ is a text interface with your computer<br>

Appendix / List of commands can be found here: <br>
https://www.codecademy.com/article/command-line-commands <br>

folders aka _directories_ <br>
filesystem <br>
tree structure <br>
first director = _root directory_ aka _parent directory_ <br>
child directories, parent-child relationship, nesting <br>
command: _ls_ (lists all files and directories) <br>
terminal <br>
_shell prompt_ $ <br>
command: _pwd_ ("print working directory") <br>
command: _cd_ ("change directory") <br>

"When a file, directory, or program is passed into a command, it is called an _argument_." <br>

command: _cd .._ <br>
"The argument .. stands for the directory above the current working directory." <br>
_relative path_ <br>
"We can also move up multiple directories using the .. argument." <br>
Example: _cd ../.._ <br>
Move up and over, example: _cd ../directory_ <br>

command: _mkdir_ (make directory) <br>
"The _touch_ command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument and then creates an empty file with that name in the current working directory." <br>

_tab_ can be used to autocomplete your command <br>
up and down arrows can be used to cycle through past commands <br>
_clear_ can be used to clear the view of your terminal (doesn't undo anything) <br>
